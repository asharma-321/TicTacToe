# TicTacToe
# Made by Aayushi and Joelle
# This program allows 2 players to engage in a game of tic tac toe.
# Program asks for Player names, then flips a coin to determine who goes first. Players are asked to input a number 1-9 to place a mark on the board, with boxes 1-3 on going from the top left to top right of the tic tac toe board, and etc. A board is plotted and the marks on the board are made using the BoardPlot function. A Checkwin function checks if there are 3 marks in a row after every turn. If a player wins, a win statement is displayed. If it ends in a tie, a tie statement is shown. After the conclusion of a round, the players are asked if they want to play again. If not, the program ends.
